## My process
First, I сreated the HTML structure.
I connected fonts via googlefonts.
Transferred colors from style-guide to corresponding СSS variables.
When styling, I used the before, after pseudo-elements to create the hover effects. Added shadows and some responsiveness.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
